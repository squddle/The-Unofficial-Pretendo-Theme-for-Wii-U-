# The-Unofficial-Pretendo-Theme-for-Wii-U-
This is exactly as the title states. It's a unofficial theme for Homebrewed Wii U consoles that changes all references to Nintendo services to be related to Pretendo, when necessary.

This was done with assistance via the Pretendo Network and Theme Cafe Discord servers, utilising MSBT Editor Reloaded, Switch Toolbox, and WinSCP in conjunction with FTPiiU.
