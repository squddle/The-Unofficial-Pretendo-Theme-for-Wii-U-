# The-Unofficial-Pretendo-Theme-for-Wii-U-
This is exactly as the title states. It's a unofficial theme for Homebrewed Wii U consoles that changes all references to Nintendo services to be related to Pretendo, when necessary.

This was done with assistance via the Pretendo Network and Theme Cafe Discord servers, utilising MSBT Editor Reloaded, Switch Toolbox, and WinSCP in conjunction with FTPiiU.

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
HOW TO INSTALL THE THEME:

Step 0) Get a NAND backup of your console, just in case!

Step 1) Download "Pretendo Theme.zip" from Releases.

Step 2) Extract the folder in downloads, desktop, really wherever you'd like! Just keep track if it!

Step 3) Inside of the new "Pretendo Theme" folder, there is a folder called "sdcafiine". Copy that folder.

Step 4) On your Wii U SD Card, open the "wiiu" folder. Paste the "sdcafiine" folder here. 

Step 5) That's it! Good luck and have fun!
